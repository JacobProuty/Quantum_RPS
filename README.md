# Quantum_RPS
The purpose of the program is to be able to play the game
Rock, Paper, Scissors with a quantum mechanics twist. This
adds a bit of true randomness to the game while keeping things
generally in-line with how we intuitively understand the game.
This is just a basic assignment to keep programming skills up
and may possibly be used as a teaching tool in the future.
Good for introducing basic concepts in both quantum mechanics
and coding in Python and Qiskit.

Quantum Mechanics concepts introduced: Superposition, Bell States, Measurement
Python concepts introduced: User Input, Dictionaries, String Slicing
Qiskit concepts introduced: Creation of a user generated quantum circuit,
Creation of Bell states in a specifc orientation.
